This report was prepared to the attention of the United Nations. It analyzes the relationship between a country's GDP, its life expectancy and CO2 emissions. Our goal is to determine to what degree a countryâ€™s economic strength or weakness may be related to its public health status and impact on climate pollution. We hypothesize that both life expectancy and CO2 emissions increase with a country's GDP.
```{r read-data, include=FALSE}
gapminder_1997 <- read_csv("data/gapminder_1997.csv")

```
```{r gdp-lifeExp-1997-plot, echo=FALSE,width = 6 , height = 4, units ="in",fig.align = "center"}
# make plot of GDP (X-axis) vs lifeExp (y-axis)
ggplot(data = gapminder_1997) + 

  aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, color=continent, size=pop/1000000) +

  geom_point() +

  labs(x = "GDP Per Capita", y = "Life Expectancy",

       title= "Do people in wealthy countries live longer?", size="Population (in millions)")
```
```{r basic-counrt-stats}
#Number of countries in dataset
nCountries <-
  gapminder_1997 %>% 
  select(country) %>%
  n_distinct()

# Minimum GDP
minGDP <-
  gapminder_1997 %>% 
  summarize(round(min(gdpPercap))) %>%
  pull()

maxGDP <-
  gapminder_1997 %>% 
  summarize(round(max(gdpPercap))) %>%
  pull()


```

The number of countries in the dataset is `r nCountries`.
The minimum GDP is `r minGDP` .
The maximum GDP is `r maxGDP` .

|HEADER 1|HEADER 2|
|-------------|-------------|
|row 1, column1|row 1, column 2|
|row 2, column1|row 2, column 2|

```{r table}
gapminder_1997 %>%
  filter(continent == "Oceania") %>%
  kable()

```
The end of my analysis. 

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:
```{r}

```

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
